### Clones.u
#### (This thing makes no sense)

--

During the debut of Guns.u on the UT99.org forums, I was given an interesting
idea: What if instead of bursting into guns, players burst into tiny clones
that ran around screaming and exploding?

Well, that's pretty much it. Trust me, you might want to hold tight to your
sides, because they might get launched into orbit while playing this.

Every time a player dies, they are instantly gibbed and explode into dozens of
little guys. They will get flung around the place, screaming their little lungs
out and running around until they explode. Best of it all, nothing can stop
them from running along walls or the CEILING, even.

This mod is of course also configurable through a Clones.ini file.

Clones.u uses code from some older projects, such as SWWM or the Zanaveth Ultra
Suite. Since I am still technically the author of those, I don't have to give
anyone credit. :V

The code (ONLY the code) is released under the MIT license.

Only vanilla assets are being used.
